ft_printf
This project was completed as part of the curriculum at École 42. The goal of the project is to implement a version of the printf function from the C standard library, and to learn about variable argument lists and string manipulation in the process.

Installation
To use the ft_printf function in your own projects, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of the project.
Run the command make to compile the library.
Include the header file ft_printf.h in your source code.
Call the ft_printf function with the format string and any arguments you want to print.
Usage
The ft_printf function works much like the standard printf function, allowing you to format and print text to the console or to a file. The function takes a format string as its first argument, followed by a variable number of arguments depending on the format specifiers in the string.

Here are some examples of how to use the ft_printf function:

#include "ft_printf.h"

int main()
{
    ft_printf("Hello, world!\n");

    int num = 42;
    ft_printf("The answer is %d.\n", num);

    char *str = "example";
    ft_printf("This is an %s.\n", str);

    return 0;
}
In this example, the ft_printf function is used to print a simple message, an integer variable, and a string variable to the console.

The ft_printf function supports a wide range of format specifiers, including integers, characters, strings, and pointers. For a full list of format specifiers and their descriptions, see the ft_printf.h header file.
